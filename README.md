XMove
=====

MEMS-based motion detection &amp; analysis system like Mircosoft Kinect

##Basic:

XMOVE is a motion detection project from 2010-2013. All software and hardware are desinged by our group from BUPT. 
This git-project makes all and **only** embedded code open-source. The core MCU is MSP430 designed by TI.

## All hardware:

 2 node on hands as controllor.
 20 nodes on body.
 1 node receive wireless data and process it.

## Parts of software:
I developed a MCU-base system like this:

All code edited by hand (Of course,or by my ass?)

## How it works like:
This is a Unity3D based demo to demonstrate how it works:
