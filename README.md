XMove
=====

MEMS-based motion detection &amp; analysis system like Microsoft Kinect 

##Basic:

XMOVE is a motion detection project from 2010-2013. All software and hardware are desinged by our group from BUPT.  

This git-project makes all and **only** embedded code open-source. The core MCU is MSP430 designed by TI.

## All hardware:

 2 node on hands as controllor.**(folder hand and HandOldSimplify)**  
 
 20 nodes on body.**(folder Node)**  
 
 1 node receive wireless data and process it.**(folder Managed430)**  
 
 
## Parts of software:
I developed a MCU-base system like this:

All code edited by hand (Of course,or by my ass?)  


## How it works like:
This is a Unity3D based demo to demonstrate how it works:
